# algorithmic composition
◕ ◞ ◕ This project was made using https://netnet.studio

Making chaotic-sounding chords inspired by the Fibonacci sequence! My initial idea was to have something that the user can manipulate, so I came up with the idea of using some notes to generate more notes through math and randomization. This was technically challenging for me because I don't have experience with music and I've never coded anything that takes user input. I'm satisfied with how the interface came out, but I hope to improve how the music sounds in the future.
